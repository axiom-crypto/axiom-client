## What is Axiom?

[Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz/) allows smart contracts to compute over the entire history of Ethereum. Smart contracts can query Axiom on-chain, and Axiom results are verified on-chain in ZK and delivered to the target smart contract via callback.

This SDK provides core utility functions to write an Axiom circuit and interface with it.
