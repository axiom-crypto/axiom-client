# Axiom Client SDK

## What is Axiom?

[Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz/) allows smart contracts to compute over the entire history of Ethereum. Smart contracts can query Axiom on-chain, and Axiom results are verified on-chain in ZK and delivered to the target smart contract via callback.

This SDK provides utility functions to write an Axiom circuit and interface with it from node.js or CLI.

## Getting Started

Starting a new Axiom project is easy:

```bash
npx create-axiom-client
```

Set a directory to start your project in and then select `Script` in the options list to scaffold a new Axiom quickstart app.
