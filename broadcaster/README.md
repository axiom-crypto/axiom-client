## What is Axiom?

[Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz/) allows smart contracts to compute over the entire history of Ethereum. Smart contracts can query Axiom on-chain, and Axiom results are verified on-chain in ZK and delivered to the target smart contract via callback.

## Broadcaster

The broadcaster module provides utility functions to send data between chains.
