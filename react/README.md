# Axiom React Components

## What is Axiom

[Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz/) allows smart contracts to compute over the entire history of Ethereum. Smart contracts can query Axiom on-chain, and Axiom results are verified on-chain in ZK and delivered to the target smart contract via callback.

This package provides React components and hooks to help you integrate Axiom into your React or Next.js webapp.

## Getting Started

Starting a new Axiom project is easy:

```bash
npx create-axiom-client
```

Set a directory to start your project in and then select `Next.js` in the options list to scaffold a new Axiom Next.js dApp.
